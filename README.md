# Cplusplus-Program - ChadaTechClock

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
## This project was the first project in the course and covered creating a clock that would output a 12 and 24 hour clock, written in C++. I needed to include a header function that was called too, and provide clearly written comments.

# What did you do particularly well?
## I think I succeeded in making the main() function in main.cpp as light as I could. Everything is mostly written in the ChadaTechClock.h file.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
## I think my comments are a little overboard, but this is because I wanted a good grade and needed my thoughts to be clearly written. I would probably clear some of the comments since a lot of them are redundant.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
## Going back and forth between the header file and main file was a bit difficult to get my head around at first and I'm sure I'll need more practice for going faster in the future. Keeping track of the variables I used was also a pain... However, double and triple checking made it take even longer. I'm sure that also gets faster with time. Luckily I'm a fast typer, but even that can bite you in the end with a single typo.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
## I liked the function writing in this project and it was definitely transferable to the other projects. It helped build the foundation I needed for the future projects. I also realized the difference between public and private (even though I learned it in an earlier course, it solidified with this project)

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
## I made sure to really write out my code effectively with many comments in case it took me a while to finish the project. In the end, every one of the projects in this course took me a day to do. I was playing catch up the entire course due to work issues, but ultimately I caught up and it served me well to push through and try and finish strong. I like C++ a lot and hope to develop some programs and games with the language.
